# Easygen

EasyGen is a visual user interface to help set up simple neural network generation tasks.

There are a number of neural network frameworks (Tensorflow, TFLearn, Keras, PyTorch, etc.) that implement standard algorithms for generating text (e.g., recurrent neural networks, sequence2sequence) and images (e.g., generative adversarial networks). They require some familairity with coding. Beyond that, just running a simple experiment may require a complex set of steps to clean and prepare the data.

For example: to use a neural network to generate a history for a fictional country, I would:
1. Get superhero names from somewhere. If it is Wikipedia, we see a lot of names are followed by parentheticals.
2. Strip off parenthetical information.
3. Remove empty lines and strip off any whitespace at the end of lines.
4. Feed the resultant file into a character-rnn algorithm.
5. Run the resultant model and store the outputs to a file.

EasyGen allows one to quickly set up the data cleaning and neural network training pipeline using a graphical user interface and a number of self-contained "modules" that implement stardard data preparation routines. EasyGen differs from other neural network user interfaces in that it doesn't focus on the graphical instantiation of the neural network itself. Instead, it provides an easy to use way to instantiate some of the most common neural network algorithms used for generation. EasyGen focuses on the data preparation.
